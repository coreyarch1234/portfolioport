# Problem:
Developers that do not have the web development skills to build personal portfolios need an easy way to showcase their projects. Current solutions such as, wordpress (content heavy and can be cumbersome to customize), paper resumes (not descriptive enough), LinkedIn (has many different objectives rather than solely for developers to showcase their projects) can be heavily improved. 


# Solution:
ProductFolio is a web app that provides simple, beautiful templates for developers to use for showcasing their products. 


##Framework Details:
* Ruby 2.3.1
